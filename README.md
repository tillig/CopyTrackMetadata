# CopyTrackMetadata

Windows Forms utility that uses the iTunes SDK to copy metadata from one track to another.

As I find errors in tracks or re-rip tracks from lower-bitrate MP3 to Apple Lossless, I want to keep the metadata - title, artist, playlist membership, play count, and so on - as I update to use the fixed/new track. Much of this isn't exposed through the UI, so I wrote this utility.
